    <p><strong>Q<sub>no1:</sub>What is chemical equilibrium?</strong></p>
    <p>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Chemical equilibrium:</b></dt>
            <dd>A state of a chemical reaction in which forward and reverse 
                reactions take place at the same rate is called chemical equilibrium.</dd>

    <p><strong>Q<sub>no2:</sub>State the law of Mass Action.</strong></p>

        <dl>
            <dt><b>Law of Mass Action:</b></dt>
        </dl>
    </p>
    <p>It states that the rate at which a substance reacts is directly proportional
         to its active mass and the rate at which the reaction proceeds is directly 
         proportional to the product of the active masses of the reactants.</p>
         <p><strong>Q<sub>no3:</sub>State conditions for equilibrium.</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Concentration of none of the reactants or products is changed.</li>
                        <li>Temperature of the system is kept constant.</li>
                        <li>Pressure or volume of the system is kept constant.</li>

         <p><strong>Q<sub>no4:</sub>What is the importance of equilibrium constant for a chemical
             reaction?</strong></p>
             <p>Equilibrium constant for a reaction can be used to predict many important features
                 of a chemical reaction. It can be used to
                a.

                                 of equilibrium mixture knowing the
                                  initial concentration of reactants.</li>
