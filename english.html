    <p>Once there lived a wood-cutter in a village. He was very
        poor. He used to cut the trees in the nearby forest to sell
        the wood in the market. </p>
    <p>One day, he was cutting a tree just on the bank of a river
        . By chance, his axe slipped and fell into the river. He was helpless.
        His axe was the only source of earning for him. He started crying bitterly.
        The angel of mercy appeared before him. He asked the woodcutter
        why he was crying. The woodcutter told him the whole matter. </p>
    <p>The angel took pity on him. He dived into the river and came up with a
        golden axe. He asked the woodcutter if that was his axe. The woodcutter
        told that that was not his axe.The angel dived into the water again and
        appeared with a silver axe.
        The woodcutter again refused to take that axe as that was not his.
        The angel dived the third time and brought the iron axe. The woodcutter
        was overjoyed to see his own axe. He accepted that at once.The angel was
        greatly impressed by his honesty. He gave him the other three axes as a
        reward for his honesty.

        <center>Story:Union is Strength </center>
    </h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, a farmer lived in a village. He had four sons.
        They were quarrelsome and did not live with peace. Their hatred
        for each other irritated the farmer. He advised them to live in
        peace but in vain. He thought of a plan.
    </p>
    <p>He sent for his sons. When they came, he asked them to bring a bundle of
        sticks. They brought the bundle and tied them tight with a sturdy rope.
        The farmer asked his eldest son to break the bundle. He tried his best
        but could not break the bundle. Then the farmers one by one asked his
        sons to break the bundle. No one could break the bundle.
    </p>
    <p>The farmer asked them to untie the sticks. Now he gave one stick to every
        son and asked them to break the sticks. They easily broke the sticks. </p>
    <p>The farmer said, â€œNow see the power of unity. This is how unity makes you
        strong. The tied sticks were powerful because they were united in one single
        bundle. None of you could break them. </p>
    <p>Now when they are separated, you have easily broken them. Similarly,
        if you live with the union, nobody can harm you. If you will live an
        individual life, every one of you is easy to be destroyed. So the
        strength lies in This advice has a great influence on his sons and
        they started living in peace.</p>
    <p><b>Moral Lesson:</b>Union is Strength. United we stand, divided we fall.

           peace and delight. After eating the poisoned food, they met their maker.
