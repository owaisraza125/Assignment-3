    <p><strong>Q<sub>no:1</sub>:</h3>What is simple harmonis motion?</strong></p>
    <p>The special kind of vibratory motionof a body,whose acceleration is directly proportional
         to its displacement from mean or equilibruim position,is called <b>simple harmonic motion.</b>

    <p><strong>Q<sub>no2: </sub>Why do we use shock absorbers in vehicles?</strong></p>

            <dt><b>Use of Shock absorbers:</b></dt>
            <dd>When vehicles are passing over the vertocies and depressions of a rough
                 road they will collides with them for a very short period. This causes
                  impulse effect.
                Due to large mass and high speed of the vehicles the magnitude of impulse
                 is also high Impulse may cause damage to the car or even to the passengers in it.
                The bad effects of impulse is less if time of contact is more Impulse ] = Ft.</dd>

    <p><strong>Q<sub>no3:</sub>Same masses are attached to different springs, one is vibrating faster.
         Why?</strong></p>
         <p>Two important factors do affect the period of a simple harmonic oscillator.
            The period is related to how stiff the system is. A very stiff object has a large force 
            constant 'k', which causes the system to have a smaller period.
            For example, you can adjust a diving board's stiffness - the stiffer it is, the faster
             it vibrates, and the shorter its period. Period also depends on the mass of the oscillating
              system. The more massive the system is, the longer the period.</p>
              <p><strong>Q<sub>no4:</sub>Why do water waves refract at the boundary of shallow water and
                 deep water in ripple tank experiment?</strong></p>
                 <p> Water waves refract at the boundary of shallow and deep water because the speed of
                     waves in water is influenced by the depth of water. When a wave travels from shallow
                      to deep or deep to shallow water its velocity changes, this change in velocity 
                      causes refraction of the wave.
                    * Water refracts at the boundary of shallow and deep water due to change in 
                    speed and wavelength of waves. When the speed of waves decreases their wavelength
                     also changes. As a resuit the wave changes its direction i.e. refracted</p>
                     <p><strong>Q<sub>no5:</sub> Under what conditions are the waves diffracted the most?
                    </strong></p>
                    <p> When the opening is made small (but comparable with the wavelength of waves) then
                         the waves diffract the most. The diffraction of waves depends upon the opening
                          of the obstacles. Waves are diffracted most strongly when the size of the opening
                           of obstacle is less than or equal to the size of the wavelength of generated
                            waves.</p>
